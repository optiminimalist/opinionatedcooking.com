  Move around the vegetable mixture so that there is a gap in the center of the pan and turn up the heat to full. Add ground beef and brown it in direct contact with the pan. Add salt. As it browns, mix the beef with the vegetables.

Leave mixture to simmer for 45 - 90 minutes. Check regularly to add water and stir. There should always be some water to boil off until you are ready to serve.

Serve with side of pasta. Chunky pastas that hold the sauce are recommended! Cook pasta al dente for best results.
